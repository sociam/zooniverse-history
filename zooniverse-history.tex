\section{Introduction}

Web-based ``citizen-science'' projects have enabled tens of thousands
of untrained human volunteers to contribute to open scientific
problems across a variety of domains.  The handful of successful
systems have demonstrated that citizen science applications can be
valuable both to participants, as educational tools and
cognitively-stimulating puzzles, as well as to scientific researchers
who have large unmanageable data sets and problem spaces.

However, designing successful citizen science systems that can be
mutually beneficial in this way while sustaining participation over
time can be exceedingly difficult.  The reasons are several: first,

due to the emerging nature of the field, key design principles and
\emph{best practices} are not yet known or established.  The unique
aspects of designing for citizen science mean that conventional design
methods pioneered for human computation approaches only apply to a
limited extent.  For example, human computation systems often apply
extrinsic motivation (e.g., direct rewards) to drive participation,
while most citizen science participation systems derive from intrinsic
motivations of individuals.  Since such motivations are typically
personal and idiosyncratic, designing to drive sustained attention to
them is challenging, requiring an understanding of their nature and
the activities that inspire them.  Moreover, participants naturally
engage with citizen science systems in a variety of different ways,
and feature a diversity of natural competencies, manifesting in great
variation among the ways people interact with the system. Finally, the
simple fact that, over time, people are likely to simply forget about
any particular system, as their attention is turned away towards
other, newer systems and activities means that retaining those crucial
participants who have accrued a degree of experience and competence in
their tasks is significantly challenging.

In this paper, we contribute a detailed case-study of a unique
citizen-science platform which expanded from a single domain
experiment to what has been considered a ``factory for citizen
science'', an authority for generating successful apps for scientists
with difficult problems independent of any particular domain.  Our
analysis, conducted as retrospective reflective interviews with key
members of the Zooniverse team, aimed to identify the essential
lessons learned through the trial and error process that resulted from
designing each app after the previous as an iterative process.  This
process that allowed the team to systematically explore design
variations at mutiple levels, from the interface/intraction flow, to
the design of social elements (discussion forums), to external
considerations such as ways to best launch and sustain prolonged
engagement through external communications.

The goal of the following sections of the paper are to provide a
distillation of some of informal knowledge accumulated by the
Zooniverse team, so that these experiences can both be used to derive
design recommendations and lend insight to the forces and factors that
come into play in real-world, large-scale deployments of such systems.
We begin with a short history of the project in order to document the
evolution and expansion of the system, which will be used as a context
for establishing the focused dimensional design discussions in the
following sections.  These discussions are followed with a discussion
of the implications of these observations for design and HCI research,
as well as a summary of ongoing questions being pursued by the team.

\section{Background: A Brief History of the Zooniverse}

\emph{Can someone write this up?}

% i want a slide here that shows a timeline of the project
% including each project launch and cumulative number of 
% participants at each point in time

Specific papers describing Zooniverse outcomes have been
documented \cite{}

\section{Method}

Semi-structured interviews were performed wiht N members of the
Zooniverse team, including the team lead, lead project manager, and
blah.  Interviews were recorded 

inductive process which led to the themes for the coding analysis.
These themes were used as the basis of a second round of interviews
focused on these themes, upon  which a second coding process was 
applied by 3 researchers 

\section{Launching a Citizen Science Project}

% attracting new users' attention
%   + engaging users in general
% getting noobs up to competence
% retaining experienced + most valuable participants
% expanding the user base
% dealing with new data ~
% transferring interest to other projects
% distilling knowledge from contributions : (amalgamating responses into thing)
% selecting the projects - understanding what can be turned into a good Citizen Science project

\subsection{Task Design: Presentation considerations}

%% to gameify or not?
McGonigal identified four defining elements of a game: a goal, rules, feedback system and voluntary participation. Other features such as leader boards, badges, the "winning" sensation are all used to reinforce these core concepts but do not create a game environment in their own right \cite{mcgonigal2011reality}. To further this gameplay is a state which encourages an optimistic outlook on personal capabilities, partnered with "invigorating rush of activity" \cite{mcgonigal2011reality}. These concepts would support a science citizen, creating a gameplay state to highly motivate and encourage them to undertake difficult challenges. 

%% did they create rules - placing limitations to achieving the goal -> make a challenge
%% what feedback system did they use and what was the overall goal

%% icebergs/seal hunting : people really wanted a seal. :(

%% adding context: old weather
%% achieving flow state

\subsection{Interaction Flow}

% jump straight to action, no introductory video
% start with 1 GS, interleave gold standards w/ real things

% transcribe bentham
% sad museum one 

\subsection{Forums}

%% Forums -> 
%% Introduction of Talk 1.0 -> 
%% Introduction of Talk 2.0
%% Organisation and Fragmentation 
%% Top level organisation, moderators, scientists and how this has changed and impacted 
In a study investigating the effect of instructors on forum participation, Mazzolini and Maddison found that instructors who posted frequently on a forum on average produced shorter discussion threads \cite{mazzolini2003sage}. In the Zooniverse environment the participation of "moderators" and "scientists" could be hindering the discussion flow between general science citizens. Furthermore there was a negative correlation between instructor initiated conversations and participation, especially in the advanced units\cite{mazzolini2003sage}. 
%% @Neal does this support your findings so far?


%% Success stories: examples of super-moderators who externally test
%% contributions and distill them for the scientists
%% (why only in certain apps and not others?)
%% (how do super moderators affect the community // roles played)

\subsection{Social Engagement}

% favouriting, tweeting, blog posts

\subsection{Outreach}

% wording, how when to spam participants to get them to come back

\subsection{Launching}

% holding back subjects
