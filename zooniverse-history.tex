\section{Introduction}

Web-based ``citizen-science'' projects have enabled hundreds of
thousands of untrained human volunteers to contribute to open
scientific problems across a variety of domains
\cite{citizen-science}.  The handful of successful systems have
demonstrated that citizen science applications can be valuable both to
participants, as educational tools and cognitively-stimulating
puzzles\cite{citizen-science-in-curricula}, as well as to scientific
researchers who have large unmanageable data sets and problem spaces
\cite{fortson-2011, lintott-08, lintott-11, simpson-12, davis-11}.

However, designing successful citizen science systems that can be
mutually beneficial in this way while sustaining participation over
time can be exceedingly difficult.  The reasons are several: first,
due to the emerging nature of the field, key design principles and
\emph{best practices} are not yet known or established.  The unique
aspects of designing for citizen science mean that conventional design
methods pioneered for human computation approaches only apply to a
limited extent.  For example, human computation systems often apply
extrinsic motivation (e.g., direct rewards) to drive participation,
while most citizen science participation systems derive from intrinsic
motivations of individuals \cite{extrinsic-vs-intrinsic}.  Since such
motivations are typically personal and idiosyncratic, designing to
drive sustained attention to them is challenging, requiring an
understanding of their nature and the activities that inspire them
\cite{}.  Moreover, participants naturally engage with citizen science
systems in a variety of different ways, and feature a diversity of
natural competencies, manifesting in great variation among the ways
people interact with the system \cite{raddick}. Finally, the simple
fact that, over time, people are likely to simply forget about any
particular system, as their attention is turned away towards other,
newer systems and activities means that retaining those crucial
participants who have accrued a degree of experience and competence in
their tasks is significantly challenging.

% we want to switch this from interviews to (in crowd)
In this paper, we contribute a detailed case-study of a unique
citizen-science platform which expanded from a single domain
experiment to what has been considered a ``factory for citizen
science'', an authority for generating successful web applications for
scientists with difficult problems independent of any particular
domain.  Our analysis, conducted as retrospective reflective inductive
thematic analysis, aimed to identify the essential lessons learned
through the trial and error process that resulted from designing each
app after the previous as an iterative process.  This process that
allowed the team to explore design variations at mutiple levels, from
the interface/intraction flow, to the design of social elements
(discussion forums), to external considerations such as ways to best
launch and sustain prolonged engagement through external
communications.

% note: add the fact that this is data analysis not data acquisition
The goal of the this paper is to, first, document the informal
knowledge gathered by the Zoonvierse team pertaining to how to design
successful citizen science projects, based on their experience of
launching 24 projects since the platform's genesis.  These insights
are then discussed in the greater context of human computation, to
derive design recommendations and discuss factors that may be
responsible for the observations made. We begin with a short history
of the project in order to provide readers a context for the following
discussion, followed by a grounded dimensional design analysis of
particular aspects of Zooniverse's deployment.  Finally, we discuss 
Zooniverse's team's perspective of the greatest difficulties for
building more effective citizen science: <X>, <Y> and <Z>, and
ways that HCI research may be able to help.

\section{Background: A Brief History of the Zooniverse}

\emph{TODO: Can someone fill this in?}  The Zooniverse system was
conceived .. \cite{fortson2011galaxy} unlike citizen-science projects
that focus on citizen data collection, the focus of Zooniverse is data
analysis, that is looking at data that was collected through
scientific instruments or other means.
% http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5513
% 

As documented previously by Raddick et al \cite{raddick}, the first
Zooniverse project, Galaxy Zoo,designed to engage volunteers in the
morphological classification of images of galaxies, launched in July
2007\cite{galaxyzoo-launch}. 

\emph{AND THEN STUFF HAPPENED!}  

As of September 2013, the most recent projects were \emph{Worm Watch
  Lab}, launched in June 2013, $24$th project to launch

Table $X$ lists all of the Zooniverse projects, launch dates, sizes of
data sets and classifications as of September 2013.  Figure $Y$,
likewise, illustrates the growth of the project from June 2007 until
September 2013.

\section{Method}
\emph{TO BE WRITTEN LATER}
%% Four sessions were dedicate to performing a group thematic
%% analysis. Participants from the Zooniverse team included the team
%% lead, lead project manager, and two designers of the Planet Hunters
%% application.  Interviews were recorded and transcribed,

%% inductive process which led to the themes for the coding analysis.
%% These themes were used as the basis of a second round of interviews
%% focused on these themes, upon which a second coding process was
%% applied by 3 researchers

\section{Findings} % Themes? Observations?

\subsection{Key components of a citizen science project}
% almost always needs a discussion space

%% from emax --- 
% attracting new users' attention
%   + engaging users in general
% getting noobs up to competence
% retaining experienced + most valuable participants
% expanding the user base
% dealing with new data ~
% transferring interest to other projects
% distilling knowledge from contributions : (amalgamating responses into thing)
% selecting the projects - understanding what can be turned into a good Citizen Science project

\subsection{Engagement}
% Boring project problem - a constraint that led to development and
% technological change

\subsection{Task Design: Presentation considerations}
%% to gameify or not?
McGonigal identified four defining elements of a game: a goal, rules, feedback system and voluntary participation. Other features such as leader boards, badges, the "winning" sensation are all used to reinforce these core concepts but do not create a game environment in their own right \cite{mcgonigal2011reality}. To further this gameplay is a state which encourages an optimistic outlook on personal capabilities, partnered with "invigorating rush of activity" \cite{mcgonigal2011reality}. These concepts would support a science citizen, creating a gameplay state to highly motivate and encourage them to undertake difficult challenges. 

%% did they create rules - placing limitations to achieving the goal -> make a challenge
%% what feedback system did they use and what was the overall goal

%% icebergs/seal hunting : people really wanted a seal. :( 
%% audio :: 
%% posters vs 

%% adding context: old weather
%% achieving flow state

\subsection{Interaction Flow}
% jump straight to action, no introductory video
% start with 1 GS, interleave gold standards w/ real things

% transcribe bentham
% sad museum one 

\subsection{Forums}

%% Forums -> 
%% Introduction of Talk 1.0 -> 
%% Introduction of Talk 2.0
%% Organisation and Fragmentation 
%% Top level organisation, moderators, scientists and how this has changed and impacted 
In a study investigating the effect of instructors on forum participation, Mazzolini and Maddison found that instructors who posted frequently on a forum on average produced shorter discussion threads \cite{mazzolini2003sage}. In the Zooniverse environment the participation of "moderators" and "scientists" could be hindering the discussion flow between general science citizens. Furthermore there was a negative correlation between instructor initiated conversations and participation, especially in the advanced units\cite{mazzolini2003sage}. 
%% @Neal does this support your findings so far?


%% Success stories: examples of super-moderators who externally test
%% contributions and distill them for the scientists
%% (why only in certain apps and not others?)
%% (how do super moderators affect the community // roles played)

\subsection{Social Engagement}
% favouriting, tweeting, blog posts

\subsection{Outreach}

% wording, how when to spam participants to get them to come back

\subsection{Launching}
% Andromeda and Snapshot Serengeti as case studies

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Common Myths of Citizen Science}
% \subsection{$D$ Myths of Designing for Citizen-Science}
% \subsection{Myth $X$: Putting new users through a ``tutorial'' is a good idea}
% \subsection{Myth $Y$: Gameification keeps people motivated}
% \subsection{Myth $Z$: Participants become domain experts}
% \subsection{Myth $Z$: Beautiful pictures are necessary}

\subsection{Themes We See Support For}
% \subsection{Design Builds Trust}
% \subsection{What makes a good domain?}
