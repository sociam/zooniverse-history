\section{Introduction}

Citizen-science is a form of human-powered computation \cite{} that
can be both beneficial to those who participate, as an educational
tool and cognitively-stimulating source of entertainment, and an
effective method of producing significant, novel scientific
findings. Crowd-powered citizen science projects have already
facilitated dozens (hundreds?) of findings \cite{}, through the
collective contributions of hundreds of thousands of volunteers.

However, designing effective and efficient citizen-powered science
systems that can achieve both of these goals can be challenging and
time consuming.  First, systems must cope with a wide range of
participant expertise, ranging from no prior knowledge in the field to
significant background and interest.  Moreover, particpants naturally
feature a wide diversity of natural competencies; some people are
simply much better at particular tasks than others. Finally, there are
a large variety of issues pertaining to keeping individuals motivated
and interested while participating, and allowing individuals to engage
with the system at a variety of different levels and degrees of
investment, from the ``sunday scientist'' to regular participation.

In this paper, we provide a detailed case study of a citizen-science
platform which offers the unique affordance of having expanded to more
than twenty distinct, successful science projects over the course of
its two year evolution, on top of a single unified framework known as
Zooniverse.  The path from its first experimental app, Galaxy Zoo, to
the more than twenty different projects that have launched on the
Zooniverse project required generalising the findings from the first
project to different kinds of tasks in other scientific domains.

%%  naturally Participants come from a wide
%% audience % with a massive variety of backgrounds and competencies,
%% such systems interface down to the workflow of how participants' input
%% is collated, verified, and provided as feedback to the participants,
%% along with the nature and kind(s) of affordances provided for
%% communicating and discussing remains challenigng

%% interfaces that have
%% appropriate affordances, the and features remains challenging, due
%% to the wide number of design considerations that mustbe taken
%% jointly into account.

%% Wide variety of expertise
