\section{Introduction}

Citizen-science is a type of human-powered computation \cite{} that
can be both beneficial to those who participate, as both an
educational tool and cognitively-stimulating source of entertainment,
as well as an unprecedented method of faciliting the discovery of
significant, novel scientific findings. The result of the relatively
few citizen-science projects on the Web today have already generated a
comparably large number of findings \cite{}, through the collective
contributions of hundreds of thousands of volunteers.

However, designing effective science apps that can achieve both goals
can be challenging.  First, such systems must appeal to participants
with an extremely wide range of expertise, ranging from no knowledge
of the field to significant background and interest.  Moreover,
particpants naturally feature a diversity of natural competencies,
which is manifested in some people being simply much more adept at
some tasks than others. Finally, there are a large variety of issues
pertaining to keeping individuals motivated, interested, and deriving
personal benefit while participating, as well as supporting various
degrees of engagement -- from the ``sunday scientist'' to the
``scienceoholic''.

In this paper, we provide a detailed case study of a citizen-science
platform which offers the unique position of having expanded from one
experiment focused on a single domain to more than $X$ distinct
projects spanning $Y$ domains, including astronomy, zoology, marine
biology, archaeology, and paleontology, over its two year evolution.
These applications, though separate, have been built on top of a
single unified framework known as Zooniverse, which has been
successively refined and scaled as the variety of tasks and number of
participants have increased.

The purpose of this examination of Zooniverse is to both to document
the experience gained from launches and iterations of the various
applications, comparing these experiences against previously
documented in other citizen-science projects.  The observations derive
from a lateral examination of the

The path from its first experimental app, Galaxy Zoo, to the more than
twenty different projects that have launched on the Zooniverse project
required generalising the findings from the first project to different
kinds of tasks in other scientific domains.
