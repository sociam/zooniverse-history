\section{Introduction}

Web-based ``citizen-science'' projects have enabled tens of thousands
of untrained human volunteers to contribute to open scientific
problems across a variety of domains.  The handful of successful
systems have demonstrated that, when designed well, citizen science
applications can be valuable both to participants, as educational
tools and cognitively-stimulating puzzles, and to scientific
researchers with large data sets and complex problem spaces.

Designing effective citizen science systems that are mutually
beneficial to both participants and researchers, however, can be
daunting for even seasoned HCI practitioners.  The reasons are
several: first, due to the emerging nature of the field, \emph{best
  practices} are not yet well established.  Second, unlike in types of
human computation that apply extrinsic motivation (e.g., rewards) to
drive participation, most citizen participants are intrinsically
motivated to contribute to citizen science projects.  However, since
such motivations are typically personal and idiosyncratic, designing
to sustain prolonged relatioships is particularly challenging.
Finally, participants naturally like to engage with citizen science
systems in different ways, and feature a diversity of natural
competencies, which is manifested in some people being simply much
more adept at some tasks than others.

In this paper, we contribute a detailed case-study of a unique
citizen-science platform which expanded from a single domain
experiment to a general, open platform for launching and hosting
citizen science projects, known as Zooniverse, over its five year
evolution.  The Zooniverse framework team has derived significant has
been successively refined and scaled as the variety of tasks and
number of participants have increased.  At its current state,
currently having launched $X$ distinct applications for $Y$ scientific
domains, including astronomy, zoology, cell and marine biology,
archaeology and paleontology.  This platform represents a unique \cite{foobar}
