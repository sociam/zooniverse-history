\caption{Summary of Zooniverse projects past and present, including each projects status as of September 2013.  The 1.68 million assets in the various Galaxy Zoo projects are not unique, since galaxies in GZ1 were used in subsequent projects.}

% According to neemo.zooniverse.org, NEEMO had 47,943 user validations, though this may differ from "logged-in users." Particularly because two figures are given - 485 volunteers joined the mission.

In contrast to crowd-sourcing and citizen science projects that focus on participant-driven data collection (e.g., \cite{okolloh2009ushahidi}, \cite{zook2010volunteered}), the focus of Zooniverse is exclusively citizen \emph{data analysis}, that is, having participants help with the classification, labeling and extraction of information from large, already extant datasets. As documented previously by Fortson et al \cite{fortson2011galaxy}, the first Zooniverse project, \emph{Galaxy Zoo}\footnote{Galaxy Zoo - \url{www.galaxyzoo.com}}, engaged volunteers in the morphological classification of images of galaxies, and launched in July 2007 \cite{galaxyzoo-launch}.  The first scientific papers that resulted from findings from Galaxy Zoo's over 100,000 citizen contributors were published in 2008, on spin statistics of spiral galaxies\cite{land2008galaxy} and the morphological characteristics of galaxies\cite{lintott2008galaxy}.

% Mention Hanny's Verwoop and Green Peas here
The success of Galaxy Zoo 1 generated significant interest, and it became clear that there would be more projects to follow.  The first such project was \emph{Solar Stormwatch}\footnote{Solar Stormwatch - \url{www.solarstormwatch.com}}, effectively built for the Royal Observatory of Greenwich by Zooniverse.  The first non-astronomy project, \emph{Old Weather}\footnote{Old Weather - \url{www.oldweather.org}}, launched in October 2010 and applied volunteers to transcribe historical, hand-written weather measurements from official logs of merchant trading ships from the period of 1780-1830.  As of September 2013, the Zooniverse family of projects has benefited from the participation of $XXX,XXX$ volunteers who have collectively contributed over $NNN,NNN,NNN$ classifications to the system.

Table 1 lists all of the Zooniverse projects by launch date, along with their current status, their web site locations, sizes of data sets, and task type, as of September 2013. \emph{Retired} projects are projects where sufficient classifications have already been acquired for each subject and users can no longer submit classifications. \emph{Active} projects are projects where classifications are still required and users can still submit classifications to the system. \emph{Classifying} tasks ask users to identify the presence, types, and potentially number of things visible in each subject.  An example of such a task is identifying and counting the number of animals visible in a particular automatically-taken photo, taken by motion-detecting camera in \emph{Snapshot Serengeti}. \emph{Marking} tasks involve the additional step of indicating where in the image the particular object is found, for example, identifying the location of organisms in the undersea images of \emph{Seafloor Explorer}.  Finally, \emph{transcribing} tasks involve reading, often deciphering difficult-to-read, text and characters typically from old handwritten texts, such as the ship logs in \emph{Old Weather} or registers of museum specimens in \emph{Notes from Nature}.

Figure 1, likewise, illustrates the growth of the project from June 2007 until September 2013. The complete list of scientific papers that have resulted from Zooniverse are compiled on the Zooniverse Blog\footnote{Zooniverse Publications - \url{www.zooniverse.org/publications}}.

The Galaxy Zoo project alone has produced thirty nine scientific papers, including a catalogue of galaxy morphologies \cite{lintott2008galaxy} and papers on its two most famous discoveries, the ``Hanny's Voorwerp" \cite{lintott2009galaxy} and the ``Green Peas", a previously unknown class of galaxy \cite{cardamone2009galaxy}.  Pertaining to the Zooniverse projects themselves, Raddick et al conducted interview studies to understand the motivations of Galaxy Zoo project participants \cite{raddick2010galaxy}. Each Zooniverse project has its own dedicated blog for milestones and other announcements (e.g., \cite{galaxyzooblog}), while a separate, overarching blog has documented news of major milestones, events and discoveries across all Zooniverse projects to the wider community \cite{zooniverseblog}.

\subsection{Zooniverse Terminology and Overview}
% elena notes:
% 'ultimately responsible for the project' - explain this --  zooniverse team were taking over lots of these tasks but now they're providing the tools for the science teams to have more autonomy.
In the remainder of this paper, we adopt the Zooniverse team's terminology for describing the system and its components, which we briefly summarise here. In the context of Zooniverse, \emph{projects} are proposed to the core Zooniverse team by researchers who become the project's \emph{science team}.  The science team are ultimately responsible for the project once launched.  Each project represents a single, specific line of inquiry and data set, and is launched as a separate web site, with a dedicated discussion forums,  and associated social media channels, including a blog, Twitter account and Facebook page.  Volunteer participants, referred to as \emph{users}, who sign up to any Zooniverse project can contribute to any of the others through links at the top of each Zooniverse project site.

%% 'asset' in the table -> 'subject' - The table currently appears before the terminology section, so it may be
%% necessary to make clear what subjects refer to prior to this, as this is a somewhat unorthodox usage of 'subject'
Users who are the top contributors may be appointed \emph{moderators}, who are granted special privileges in the discussion forums, and granted access to contacting the \emph{science teams} who ultimately run each project. The term \emph{subject} refers to the individual assets that users are tasked with classifying.  Subjects may consist of images, audio files or videos. \emph{Tasks} are the particular activities which users carry out when presented with a subject, such as identifying the presence and shape of a galaxy in a set of subjects. Subjects are typically organised into \emph{groups}, which represent a particular data set collection, such as those from a particular time period or source such as the Hubble telescope.  Finally, a \emph{Classification} is a single classifying, marking or transcribing action performed by a single user, upon a subject, within the context of some task, of a project.
